# Changing The Theme

To change the theme, you can navigate up to the top bar, and click the button with an icon that has 3 sliders.
From there, you can click the `Change Theme` button! Enjoy as your wallpaper animates into the new one,
and everything just changes color! :D

If you want to use a keyboard shortcut, you can use `MOD + SHIFT + T` to bring up the theme switcher.
