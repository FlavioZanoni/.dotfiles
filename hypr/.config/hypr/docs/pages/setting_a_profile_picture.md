# Setting A Profile Picture

By default, you may notice that locking your screen shows a default profile picture. Want to change that? Well, it is quite easy!

Here are the steps:

1. Make sure you have a square image in the format of a PNG (`.png`) file.
2. Save that file as: `~/.hyprland_rice/face.png` (`~/.hyprland_rice` is where user-specific settings go.)

Now, when you lock your screen, you should see your custom profile picture! :D
